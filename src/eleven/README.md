# ElevenLabs Agent Call Widget

Simple web app that embeds the ElevenLabs conversational AI agent call widget.

## Setup

1. **Replace the agent ID**: In `index.html`, change `YOUR_AGENT_ID` to your ElevenLabs agent ID.
   - Get your agent ID from the [ElevenLabs Agents dashboard](https://elevenlabs.io/app/agents/dashboard)
   - Ensure your agent is **public** with **authentication disabled** (in Advanced → Security)

2. **Run the app**:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
   Opens at http://localhost:3000

Or open `index.html` directly in a browser (some features may require serving over HTTP).
