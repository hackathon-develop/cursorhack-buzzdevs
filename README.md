# cursorhack - team buzzdevs

For a view on the complete hackathon end release version also look at https://github.com/hackathon-develop/cursorhack-buzzdevs-gatebuddy-concierge.

Plan was to have a integrated app with airpot navigation, call integration via elevenlabs and attached n8n workflows.
- the n8n and elevenlab parts were cloud built & hosted and are not documented as source here.  
- the integration of the elevelabs widget into https://github.com/hackathon-develop/cursorhack-buzzdevs-gatebuddy-concierge worked.
- the integration of the prepared map component was not started.
